# customer_segmentation
This project involves applying data mining and machine learning techniques to divide a large customer base into smaller, more meaningful segments.


The main goal of this project is to analyze customer data and group customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, or spending patterns. This helps businesses understand their customers better, design targeted marketing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction and retention.The project aims to identify natural clusters in the data — for example, customers who spend similarly, have similar shopping habits, or belong to similar age and income groups.

The project involves preprocessing the data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and selecting relevant variables, followed by exploratory data analysis to understand patterns and relationships through visualizations like scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps.

Each cluster is interpreted based on its characteristics—for instance, high-income high-spending customers, low-income low-spending customers, or moderate-income average-spending customers—providing actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns.

It imports essential libraries: pandas for handling datasets, matplotlib for visualizations, StandardScaler from scikit-learn to normalize features, and KMeans for clustering. The dataset is loaded, typically containing customer attributes like age, annual income, and spending score. Relevant features, such as Annual Income and Spending Score, are extracted and standardized using StandardScaler to ensure that differences in scale do not bias the clustering process.

Finally, the clusters are visualized using a scatter plot, highlighting how customers are grouped based on their income and spending behavior, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing and business strategies.
